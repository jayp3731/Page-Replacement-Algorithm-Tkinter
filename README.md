# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Tkinter

Tkinter is Graphical User Interfaces in Python

These are the Python(Tkinter) implementations of FIFO, LRU and Optimal page replacement algorithms.
And i have also given graph implementation for FIFO and LRU.
I have been working for Animation part for display.

I will update when i will complete that.

that was for the first file.

Second file i have implemented 2 more algorithms with graph.
i have given code to compare FIFO, LRU and Optimal page replacement algorithms with graph.

1.png file is image file used for the project.

for running this program you will need **python 3.0** and libraries **matplotlib**, **timeit**, **pandas** and **numpy**
